def hb_so_err(x, **kwargs):
    """Array (vector) of hamonic balance second order algebraic errors.

    Given a set of second order equations
    :math:`\ddot{x} = f(x, \dot{x}, \omega, t)`
    calculate the error :math:`E = \ddot{x} - f(x, \dot{x}, \omega, t)`
    presuming that :math:`x` can be represented as a Fourier series, and thus
    :math:`\dot{x}` and :math:`\ddot{x}` can be obtained from the Fourier
    series representation of :math:`x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        x is an :math:`n \\times m` by 1 array of presumed displacements. It
        must be a "list" array (not a linear algebra vector). Here
        :math:`n` is the number of displacements and :math:`m` is the number of
        times per cycle at which the displacement is guessed (minimum of 3)

    **kwargs : string, float, variable
        **kwargs is a packed set of keyword arguments with 3 required
        arguments.
            1. `function`: a string name of the
            function which returned the numerically calculated acceleration.

            2. `omega`: which is the defined fundamental harmonic
            at which the is desired.

            3. `n_har`: an integer representing the number of harmonics. Note
            that `m` above is equal to 1 + 2 * `n_har`.

    Returns
    -------
    e : array
        2d numpy vector array of numerical error of presumed solution(s) `x`

    Notes
    -----
    `function` and `omega` are not separately defined arguments so as to enable
    algebraic solver functions to call `hb_so_err` cleanly.

    The algorithm is as follows:
        1. The vector `x` is reshaped into an :math:`n` by :math:`m` array
        2. The velocity and accelerations are calculated in the same shape as
           `x` as `vel` and `accel`.
        3. Each column of `x` and `v` are sent with `t`, `omega`, and other
           `**kwargs** are sent to `function` one at a time with the results
           agregated into the columns of `accel_num`.
        4. The difference between `accel_num` and `accel` is reshaped to be
           :math:`n \\times m` by 1 and returned as the vector error used by
           the numerical algebraic equation solver.
